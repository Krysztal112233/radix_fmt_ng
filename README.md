This crate adds a tool to format a number in an arbitrary base from 2 to 36.

This is a light crate, without any dependency.

For primitive signed integers (`i8` to `i128`, and `isize`), negative
values are formatted as the two’s complement representation.

There is also one specific function for each radix that does not
already exists in the standard library, *e.g.* [`radix_3`](fn.radix_3.html)
to format a number in base 3.

Get started
-----------

Add the crate in the cargo manifest:

```toml
radix_fmt = "1"
```

Import [`radix`](fn.radix.html) in scope,
and you are ready to go:

```rust
use radix_fmt::radix;
```

Examples
--------

```rust
use radix_fmt::*;

let n = 35;

// Output: "z"
println!("{}", radix(n, 36));
// Same output: "z"
println!("{}", radix_36(n));
```

You can use the *alternate* modifier to capitalize the letter-digits:

```rust
use radix_fmt::radix;

let n = 35;

// Output: "Z"
println!("{:#}", radix(n, 36));
```

FAQ
---

* Which digits are used when the base is superior to `10`?

    > This crate uses the letters in alphabetic order. That is
why the maximum base is 36: it uses all the digits and all
the letters of the alphabet.

* Among the functions that format in a specific base, why are some missing?
For example there are `radix_7` and `radix_9`, but not `radix_8`.

    > All the numbers in range `[2, 36]` are represented except
`2`, `8`, `10` and `16` because they already exist in the
standard library through binary, octal, decimal (regular) and
hexadecimal formatting.

* What if I want to use the capitalized letters as digits?

    > Use the *alternate* modifier `{:#}`.

* Why does the formatting of negative numbers give a weird result?

    > Just as in the standard library, when a number is formatted in a
non-decimal base, the two’s complement representation is used. That means
that the number is casted to the unsigned version (for example, for an `i8`
the following number is used: `n as u8`).
